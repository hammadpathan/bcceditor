OCT 16 2019

- so orginal final ver 1 was taken down and replaced with 
new ver 1


- however in the new ver 1 I needed to remove any mention of
battle cats as to not get copyrighted

- thus the new EditorVer1.py has these changes:

- removed any trace of battle cats
- for this new ver2 of ver1 the md5 is originalmd5ver2
as where the first function is still originalmd5

- changed name to just EditorEN
